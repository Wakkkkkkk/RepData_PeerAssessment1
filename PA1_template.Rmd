## Loading and preprocessing the data

Loading the data into R
```{r cache=TRUE}
read.csv("./activity/activity.csv") -> activity
```

```{r cache=TRUE}
activity$date
```

```{r}
as.Date(activity$date)->activity$date
```


Splitting it by date
```{r}
split(activity, as.factor(activity$date)) ->sActivity
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

Create a function to take the sum of all steps on any given day
```{r}
daysums <- function(frame){
    sum(frame$steps)
}
```

Apply the function over the whole of the list, convert the result to a vector, and take the mean of that vector
```{r}
mean(unlist(lapply(sActivity, daysums)), na.rm= TRUE)
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
